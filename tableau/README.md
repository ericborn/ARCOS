## Top 10
I first chose to focused in on the top 10 distributors, by total pills, by year. Looking at the visual, you can quickly see that the top two companies, Cardinal Health and McKesson, make up a large portion contributing over 400 and 250 million respectively. The top five companies listed are responsible for distributing over 1 billion pain pills to the state of Massachusetts between 2006 and 2012.

## Percent of Total
Looking at the total pills percentage each distributor was responsible for as a bar chart really illustrates how Cardinal Health and McKesson were distributing a staggeringly large amount compared to most other companies.

## Quantity over time from Cardinal Health
Drilling down to Cardinal Health, we can see they have a steady increase in pill distributions year over year. In January 2006 they distributed 13.1 million pills, with close to a 4 million pill increased by December 2012 at 17 million total pills distributed.

## Average Pills by County
To evaluate if there was an even distribution of pills across the entire state, I next looked at the average pill distributions by county. I found the averages year over year bounced up and down depending on the county. Places like Nantucket and Dukes went down over time, while Middlesex and Bristol went up.

## Total Pills by County
Similarly to the averges by county, I wanted to see totals year over year by county. There were increases across the board in every county between 2006 and 2012. Over 5 million more pills were distributed to Bristol county, close to 7 million in both Worcester and Middlsex and over 11 million in Essex county.
